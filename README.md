Wallpaper Engine Web-based wallpaper example in Svelte and TailwindCSS for my friends.

Cute pandas included!

Before using:
Ensure you have Node 17+ and NPM installed and then in root folder perform
`npm install` - installs all required packages


Usage:

`npm run dev` - starts Vite development server

`npm run build` - builds static site in /build folder, contents of which you can copy over to your Wallpaper Engine project
